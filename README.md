## What‚Äôs inside

- **Fortnite Aimbot**: Smooth aiming with customizable FOV, bone targeting (head, body), and prediction for moving targets. Undetected against Epic's anti-cheat.
- **Fortnite Wallhack**: See enemies through walls with color-coded outlines (red for enemies, blue for teammates).
- **Fortnite ESP**: Displays player info like health, distance, weapons, and items in real-time overlays.
- **Fortnite Triggerbot**: Auto-fires when crosshair is on an enemy.
- **Recoil Control & No-Spread**: Eliminates weapon recoil and bullet spread.
- **Skin Changer & Radar Hack**: Customize character skins and get a mini-map radar for enemy positions.
- **Bypass Anti-Cheat**: Methods to evade Epic's anti-cheat system (e.g., kernel-level injection).

## Example configuration

A simple `config.ini` used by the toolkit to persist tuning values:

```ini
[Aimbot]
Enabled = true
FOV = 90
Smoothness = 5.0
TargetBone = head

[ESP]
Enabled = true
EnemyColor = red
TeamColor = blue
MaxDistance = 500

[WallVisualization]
Enabled = true
GlowIntensity = 2.0
```

## Project scope & ethics

This repository aims to be a learning resource for developers interested in real-time rendering overlays, input sampling, and experimentation with predictive smoothing algorithms. The maintainers ask contributors and users to act responsibly:

* Respect game and platform terms of service.
* Do not use research code to gain an unfair advantage on public or competitive servers.
* Use the codebase for education, security research, or UX prototyping only.
